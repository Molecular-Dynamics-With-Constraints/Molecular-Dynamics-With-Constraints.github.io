Installing mdwc
===============

Installing *mdwc* is easy, the first step is to download (clone) the 
code from its site in github `https://github.com/zeledon14/mdwc.git <https://github.com/zeledon14/mdwc.git>`_
To download the code use the command: ::

	git clone https://github.com/zeledon14/mdwc.git
	
To install *mdwc* go inside the **mdwc** directory just downloaded. 
Inside the **mdwc** directory there are other three directories (mdwc, 
scripts, and testing_data), and two files (READ.md, and setup.py). 
Inside the **mdwc** directory containing setup.py execute: ::

	python setup.py install --record mdwc_uninstall.txt
	
That's it *mdwc* is installed. The *mdwc_uninstall.txt* stores the 
installation record of *mdwc* in case future uninstallation.

To uninstall *mdwc*, go to the directory where the *mdwc_uninstall.txt* 
file is stored (usually the **mdwc** directory inside the directory where 
the git repository were cloned) and execute the command: ::

	cat mdwc_uninstall.txt | xargs rm -rf
	
After that you can remove the **mdwc** directory.
