==================
The .files File
==================

This file is very similar to the .file in abinit, there are two 
differences with the abinit .file file. First the name of the files 
written down in the .files must have a ‘*’ in between the name and the extension. 
For instance the *testing_data/c_8_data/c_8.files*:
::
	
	c_8*.in
	c_8*.out
	c_8*xi
	c_8*xo
	c_8*x
	pseudo/C.psp8
