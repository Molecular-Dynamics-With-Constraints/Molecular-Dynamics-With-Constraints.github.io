Molecular Dynamics With Constraints(mdwc)
==========================================

The molecular dynamics with constraints (*mdwc*) package is a command line 
open source python program. It does constraint molecular dynamics with 
either NPT (keeping pressure constant with the Parrinello Rahman lagrangian, 
and keeping the temperature constant with the Nose thermostat) or NVT 
(keeping the temperature constant with the Nose thermostat). mdwc does 
constraint dynamics following the SHAKE algorithm, mdwc constraints bond 
distances, angles, atomic positions, lattice parameters (a, b, c), angles 
between lattice vectors, and volume of the unit cell.

Mdwc has the *mdwc_* script to interface the mdwc code with an external 
first principles code for the calculations of energies and forces, so far, 
the only supported DFT code is `Abinit <https://www.abinit.org/>`_. You can 
use the mdwc functions to carry on constrained molecular dynamics with 
other first principals codes 
(for more details look at the jupyter notebook in the *testing_data/jupyter_notebooks* directory)
